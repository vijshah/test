Ancillary Services: Fees for baggage, seat selection, in-flight services, and airport lounges contribute significantly to American's bottom line. Expanding these offerings while ensuring customer satisfaction is essential.
External Factors:

Fuel Costs: Fluctuations in jet fuel prices significantly impact airline profitability. Hedging strategies and fuel efficiency initiatives can mitigate this risk.
Competition: The highly competitive airline industry constantly demands innovation and differentiation. Network, pricing strategies, customer service, and brand reputation play a crucial role.
Government Regulations: Changes in travel regulations, labor policies, and taxes can affect costs and demand.
Here are some additional points to consider:

Technological advancements: American is investing in digital tools for booking, check-in, and personalization, aiming to improve customer experience and drive sales.
Sustainability: Growing environmental concerns are pushing airlines towards greener practices. American's commitment to sustainability could attract eco-conscious travelers.
Overall, American Airlines' sales success depends on its ability to navigate these complex factors and adapt to a dynamic market. By focusing on key drivers like passenger demand, yield management, and strategic diversification, the airline can solidify its position in the industry.
