Chapter 1: Describe cloud concepts

* Benefits & Key Considerations
	- high availability: 
		- SLA close to 100
		- network outages, app failures (cloud design patterns) Application Insights tool for performance and reliability,
		- ease of testing on pilot users, 
		- new releases and rollback
		- system outages, 
		- power outages,  
		- upstreams / reliant systems
	- scalability, elasticity and agility
		- scale up (vertical) and out (horizontal)
		- high load spikes / seasonality / eod 
		- also scale in / down to reduce costs
		- Azure Auto-Scale service. based on usage patterns, time of day, res utils
		- agility == quickly adusting scale
	- fault tolerance and disaster recovery
		- monitor health to detect unhealthy
		- take action to recover
		- vms are allocated within infra st. unlikely to be affected by system failures
		- fault tolerance at smaller scale
		- DR applies when whole region can get affected.
			- requires reliable backups of important data
			- replicating app resources in unaffected region 
			- BCP plans / BCDR plans
	- capital and operating expenses
		- on-prem - high Capex and Opex, long acquisition and config times
		- cloud - rent model avoids capex moves to Opex. much easier to track on month to month basis, economies of scale		
	- consumption based model - pay per use eg. serverless

* Categories of cloud services
	- shared responsibility model
	- IaaS: infra only. 
		- eg. Ubuntu/Windows VM's with CPU,Disk,Memory,Network, Mgmt etc.
		- gain access to many services like Azure Security Center, Azure Backup, Azure log analytics etc.
		- reduce cost by switching off servers
		- rent capacity only when needed
		- scaling/elasticity/agility adv
		- great choice - someone manages hw infra or need high end vm for specific needs
		- App and config in cloud. can stop / start and resume 
	- PaaS: Platforms with OS and middleware software installed
		- eg. Azure app service, Az CDN, Az Cosmos DB, Az SQL DB, Az DB for MySQL, Az Storage, Az Synapse Analytics
		- reduce management expenses for custom apps. can lift and shift
		- vm's are abstracted, managed by provider
		- Azure App service for docker. Simplify packaging apps
		- App frameworks like PHP, Node.js, Java, Python etc. are bundnled
		- fault tolerance, backup/restore, DR, etc.
		- lose flexibility when to update VM for patches etc.
	- SaaS
		- eg. MS 365, Xbox, OneDrive, Power Automate (MS Flow)
	- Comparing service types
	
* Types of cloud computing
	- Public 
		- shared infra available on a public n/w
		- eg. Azure, AWS, GCP 
		- protected by Authn.
		- aka. Multi-tenant environments
		- disadv. give up some control, may not meet your security requirements, locks you into specific configs of cloud provider
	- Private
		- single tenant, chosen for privacy and regulatory concerns
		- accessible only single org
		- banks, medical providers - regulations
		- not neccesarily on prem. can be with a third party data center
	- Hybrid
		- mix of public & private
		- legacy on-prem systems, expensive to move to cloud
		- data can be left on prem
	- Community: similar to private but for a group of companies/individuals
		- not part of exam
		

Chapter 2: Describe Core Azure Services
	* Core Azure Architectural Components
		- Az regions and regional pairs
			- Geographies - boundary often a border of country. good for country specific regulations. eg. US, Canada, UK etc.
			- Regions break up geographies eg. Central US Iowa, East US Virgina, West US CA
			- Isolated regions completely dedicated to Govt data
			- Regional pairs are another logical boundary within each geography with 2 regions each. Updates applied to 1 region and once successful moved to next
			- regions in pair separated by large distances
			- Each region has data centers / physical buildings with hardware in server racks & network infra with low latency
			- services in same region have reliable fast n/w connectivity with each other
			- each data center has isolated power supply and power generators
			- garunteed round trip n/w performance of 2ms betn regions
		- Availability Zones
			- per datacenter
			- not for all regions
			- atleast 3 availability zones in each enabled region
			- can provide some fault tolerance but not for DR impacting entire region
			- some services like App Service Certificates dont make sense so not available with zones
			- Windows / Linux VM's, VM Scale sets, AKS, Zone redundant storage. VPN gateway...
			deploy to 2 or more AZ get max availability for resource. 99.99 garunteed by MS for 2 or more VMs deployed in 2 or more zones
			- Status for all services: https://status.azure.com
			- Different from Availability Sets which allow you to create 2 or more VM;s on different phys server racks in same Az datacenter. MS garunteed 99.95 for Availability Sets
			- Zonal services and zone redundant services. For HA must explicitly deploy to 2 or more zones
		- Resource Groups
			- for enterprise apps dealing with array of services spread across regions
			- resource group logical container for az services
			- deploy and manage all as single entity. can take advantage of ARM template
			- chains of arm template for multiple resource groups
			- costs of all resources within each group
			- some companies create resource groups by dept instead of apps
			- one resource can only be in one resource group
			- can move resource from one group to other but can be risky - guidance
			- script to generate arm template.
			- delete resource group cleans all resources within		
		- Az Subscriptions
			- can have one or more subscriptions
			- limits per subscription. 
			- can manage cost by creating budgets
			- invoices available for subscriptions
			- several types like free-trial, pay-as-you-go, pay as you go /dev/test (discounted rates on VM's but not for prod)
		- Management Groups
			- convinient way to apply policies and access control to Az reources
			- can only contain Az subscriptions and other mgmt groups
			- offer more precise control on who has access to which resources
			- limitations: total of 10K mgmt groups, hierachy can support 6 levels and cannot have multiple parents for single mgmt group or subscription
		- ARM Az Res Mgr
			- can be headache to manage Az services separately with multiple apps in the cloud it can be worse. tracking which service are related to which apps etc.
			- ARM runs in Az and responsible for all interaction with AZ Services
			- Works with resource providers. Eg. Microsoft.Web for app services / Microsoft.Compute for VMs to manage lifecycle
			- ARM used from Portal, CLI, API. Visual studio uses ARM API
			- ARM uses declarative JSON based syntax called ARM templates. Tell it what you want. no need to specify how
			- Tips
				- Allows to easily deploy multiple resources at once
				- Reproduce any deployment with consistent results
				- Create declarative templates instead of writing code and maintain complex deployment scripts
				- Allows setup dependencies so that resources are deployed in right order every time
				
	* Core Resources in Azure
		- Az VMs
			- hypervisor for 1 or more VM's on physical mc, guest OS may be different
			- Fault domains: logical rep of physical rack. by default 2 fault domains to 1 availability sets
			- Update domains: protect from situation where host is being rebooted and planned maintenance evts. with an availability set Az creates 5 update domains by default and spread across fault domains in the Availability set.
			- scalesets - tell Az the OD and number of VMs. 
			- Custom image with more than plain OS. can include your apps and other soft tool
			- vms in scalesets 
				- get benefit from multiple fault and update domains
				- are compatible with availability zones so protected 
				- can scale as load increases and work with AZ Auto-Scale feature
			- single VM SLA == 99.9. Multi VM SLA == 99.95		
		- Az App Service
			- PaaS
			- multiple apps on app service plans
			- fronted by AZ lb and Frontend
			- Pricing tiers - Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2
			- Charged for the plans even when no web apps are running or stopped
			- To avoid billing delete app service plan
			- Can create web apps to deploy in App Service. Options for Code / Docker Container
			- Options for manual / autoscale
			
		- Az Container Instance ACI
			- created using a zipped version of app called image. 
			- each container operates in isolated env. separated from other containers on same machine. ideal for security concerns
			- makes easy to start a container with minimal config
			- can tell ACI where to find image using Docker tag or a URL 
			- good for simple containers but not for heavy loads scenarios and need scaling. use AKS instead	
			- can create from quick start images
			- dns name label to expose to world. 
			- IMPORTANT: cannot change dns name label or image used by instance. will need to delete and recreate. Doing so will lose Public IP address so plan ahead
		- Az Kubernetes Service AKS
			- container orchestration service
			- responsible for monitoring containers and ensuring they are always running
			- can also scale up / down as needed
			- containers created in a pod - group of related containers sharing resources
			- AKS releases from resource-sharing restrictions in multi-container env
			- resources cannot be shared across pods
			- pods run on computers called node / worker with docker runtime
			- also other services for kube to manage pods and so on
			- multiple nodes managed by kube master. entire env of master and nodes is kube cluster
			- master has all config and services to manager orchestration of pods and config can be complex & laborious. services AKS popular due to this
			- operations like upgrading / scaling cluster are menu options in AZ portal
			- AKS is free, only pay for compute resources in the cluster
		- Windows Virtual desktop
			- Desktop virtualization PaaS service.
			- First create a WVD tenant
				- collection of host pools
					- consists of session hosts and one or more app groups which represent apps and OS desktops users should be able to access
					- session hosts are azure VMS configured for WVD
			- Add users from Az Active Directory and permission them
			- users can access over WVD client from Windows / MacOs/ IOS /Android / Web browsers
			- Users can have local profile and access OneDrive along with WVD
		- Virtual networks
			-AZ services can communicate with each other and with the Internet
			
		- Az VPN Gateway
		- Virtual network pairing
		- ExpressRoute
		- Container Blob Storage
		- Disk storage
		- Az Files
		- Storage Tiers
		- Cosmos DB
		- AZ SQL database
		- AZ DB for MySQL
		- AZ DB for PostgreSQL
		- AZ Marketplace
